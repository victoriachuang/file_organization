# file_organization

While you're not working within a framework, there's no "wrong" way to structure your files--however, there are better ways to do so to improve your workflow.

Remember that you're rarely going to be working on a project by yourself, so always structure your files in a way that will be easily understood by your teammates.

If all the files in a repository are stored in the root directory, then we would have to look through the files one by one. In the worst-case scenario, we would have to look at all of them before we find the file we're looking for.

However, if our files are organized by category, we can very quickly eliminate the directories and files we don't need to look through.
